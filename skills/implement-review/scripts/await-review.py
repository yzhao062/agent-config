"""await-review.py -- resolve a dispatch whose harness task was reported stopped.

A background-task notification carrying `killed` describes the harness's task
wrapper, not the reviewer. The dispatched reviewer is detached, so it outlives
its wrapper and keeps writing. This script answers the only question Phase 2
needs at that moment: is the round's review published, is the reviewer still
working, or did it provably end. See skills/implement-review/SKILL.md > Phase 1d
for when to run it.

**Silence is never death here.** The round's own timeout is what bounds a
reviewer that has gone quiet; `stall-watch` already treats ten minutes of
silence as a soft signal for the same reason, because long model generation is
silent. Turning a shorter silence into a terminal verdict would rebuild the
false-failure this script exists to remove, under a new name. `DEAD` therefore
requires evidence that the round ended, which today means one thing: a stream
death whose identity-checked reap completed. Everything else is `ALIVE`,
carrying the reason that mattered at that instant, so the caller can escalate to
its own timeout or to a human checkpoint. A published review with the wrong
round marker is reported through that reason and does not end the round, because
a reviewer can publish twice and the second write is the one worth having.

It reads the same state files as health-check.py and applies byte-identical
freshness and round-marker rules, so a REVIEW-READY verdict cannot be
contradicted by that script's state contract or by its Checks 1 to 3. It says
nothing about Checks 4 to 10: size, verification notes, and the commit
verdict stay Phase 2's job, and a REVIEW-READY review can still fail them.
tests/test_await_review.py pins the narrower agreement by running both scripts
over the same fixtures.

Usage:
  await-review.py --state-dir <abs-path> --round <N>
                  [--review-file <path>] [--timeout <s>] [--idle <s>]
                  [--poll <s>] [--quiet-for <s>] [--round-budget <s>]

The round's deadline is stamped once into <state-dir>/round-deadline, at the
round's origin plus --round-budget, and read back by every later call. It is
never rewritten, so a redispatch cannot extend the round and a caller that
lost the dispatching session's context inherits the same bound. The origin is
the earliest readable timestamp in the state directory: the root `timestamp`,
or an earlier `attempt-N/timestamp` when an automatic redispatch archived one
and rewrote the root. --timeout bounds one call; the deadline bounds the
round, and whichever comes first ends the call.

Stdout: exactly one terminal line.
  REVIEW-READY <abs-path>
  ALIVE <state-dir> reason=<reason> tail-idle=<s> tail-size=<bytes>
  DEAD <state-dir> reason=stream-death tail-idle=<s>
  TIMEOUT <state-dir> round-deadline=<epoch>
  REAP-UNKNOWN <state-dir> tail-idle=<s>

Exit code:
  0  REVIEW-READY   the round's review is published and has gone quiet
  3  ALIVE          call budget spent, round still open; run again
  4  DEAD           the round ended without a usable review
  2  checkpoint for a person: the round deadline passed (TIMEOUT), or a stream
     death never produced its reap-completion marker (REAP-UNKNOWN). Neither is
     proof of death and neither may set sticky downgrade.
  1  state-contract failure (same line shape health-check.py reports)

The default timeout stays under the 600-second cap a single foreground tool call
gets, because running this in the foreground is the point: a background probe is
exposed to the same stop it exists to diagnose.
