"""Merge a shared settings.json into a target settings.json, in place.

Both bootstrap entry points call this, so the merge semantics and the on-disk
format have one implementation instead of two. The PowerShell entry point used
`ConvertTo-Json`, whose indentation differs between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and
PowerShell 7 and matches neither `json.dumps`, so the same file was reformatted
by whichever machine touched it last. See anywhere-agents#36.

The target is user-level state shared by every consumer repo on the machine, so
two things guard it (anywhere-agents#32). The merged object is published by
rename rather than written over the target, because an interrupted in-place
write leaves a truncated file, and one such truncation cost a maintainer six
user-only keys that no backup on disk carried. A lock serializes the whole
read-merge-backup-write sequence, because a session-start burst runs one
bootstrap per consumer repo and they all write this one file. For the user-level
target that lock is the composer's per-user lock, which the composer's own
permission handler already takes; every other target gets a sibling lock. The previous
content is copied aside first, under a capped history, so a loss caused by
something outside this script stays recoverable.

Usage:
    merge_settings.py <target.json> <shared.json>

Exit codes:
    0  merged, or nothing to do
    1  a file could not be read, parsed, merged, or published
    2  bad usage
    3  another writer held the lock; the target was left alone
