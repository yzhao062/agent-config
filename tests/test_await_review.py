"""Tests for await-review.py.

The script exists because a harness task-notification carrying `killed` says
nothing about the dispatched reviewer: it is detached and outlives its wrapper.
Measured on 2026-08-21 across two repositories, six such notifications all
arrived while the reviewer was still writing, and every one of those rounds
published its review afterwards. Phase 2 therefore resolves the round from
state-dir evidence rather than from the task status.

Two properties carry the design and get the most attention below.

**Silence is not death.** A quiet tail proves nothing; `stall-watch` treats ten
minutes of it as a soft signal for the same reason. If idleness were terminal
here, the script would rebuild the false failure it exists to remove. `DEAD`
needs a stream death whose identity-checked reap completed. A published review
carrying the wrong round marker is reported and left to the round's timeout,
because a reviewer can publish twice.

**REVIEW-READY may not contradict the health check's state contract or its
Checks 1 to 3.** It says nothing about Checks 4 to 10, which stay Phase 2's job.
The integration tests at the bottom run both scripts over one fixture set,
because two hand-copied rule sets drifted apart once already: await-review
compared float mtimes while health-check truncated them, so a review written
inside the dispatch's own second was ready to one and stale to the other.
