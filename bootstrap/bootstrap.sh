# The four layers, in the resolver's precedence order: user-level, tracked,
# project-local, environment overlay. Within the three file layers an explicit
# empty list clears everything earlier, and a nonempty list selects; a file
# with no key at all leaves the running answer alone. The overlay is additive
# and so can only turn the answer on.
#
# The seed is `configured`, because the composer's default selection includes
# agent-style, so a project that has said nothing still gets a passive pack.
#
# This answers "is anything selected", not "which packs are selected". Naming
# them would mean pulling names out of YAML without a YAML parser, which is the
# fragility that produced this release; the resolver does that job whenever
# Python is present, and this runs only when it is not. Four consequences are
# known, and every one of them keeps a file that the resolver would have
# replaced, rather than deleting one it would have kept:
#
#   1. An overlay made only of subtractions cannot be evaluated without
#      resolving names, so `AGENT_CONFIG_PACKS=-agent-style` still reads as
#      configured and preserves a file the operator has opted out of.
#   2. An overlay whose additions and subtractions cancel, such as
#      `agent-style,-agent-style`, reads as one addition here and as no
#      selection in the resolver.
#   3. Marker names are never compared with selected names, so a cleared base
#      plus a project-local selection of some other pack preserves a composed
#      file carrying only the old pack's block.
#   4. The overlay is split on whitespace as well as commas; see
#      _env_pack_selection_adds.
#   5. A later layer this scanner cannot read counts as uncertainty once a
#      clear is in force, so a file holding only unrelated keys preserves where
#      the resolver would leave the clear standing. See the `none` arm below.
