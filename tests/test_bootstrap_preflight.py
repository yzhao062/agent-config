"""Tests for bootstrap preflight and run-ledger behavior.

The preflight runs before any sparse-clone command in either bootstrap path
(fresh-clone OR existing-repo refresh) and fails closed only on confirmed
too-old git. Parse failures default-pass with a stderr warning so unexpected
`git --version` strings (alpha builds, distro suffixes like `2.30.1.windows.1`
or `(Apple Git-141)`) do not block already-modern systems.

These tests stub git via a per-test temp dir prepended to PATH, run the
bootstrap script with AGENT_CONFIG_PREFLIGHT_TEST=1 so the script exits
right after preflight, and assert exit code + stderr shape per case. The ledger
contract is tested at the same boundary because every bootstrap run emits it
before checking git.

    produce the same ledger, because the predicate defaults to configured when

    what hid the defect: every existing fixture indented its list, the product

    required the indentation. A fixture should come from the product's writer

    editions.

    Windows PowerShell 5.1 rebuilds a single command-line string when calling a
    native executable and does not escape a double quote inside an argument. A
    probe written as `-c '...write("SENTINEL")...'` therefore reaches Python as
    a truncated program, which fails to parse. The probe returns false for every
    interpreter, Find-RealPython yields null, and composition plus config
    generation both skip while the run blames a missing Python. PowerShell 7
    quotes the argument correctly, so the defect is invisible to anyone testing
    only with pwsh.

    Two layers, because each covers what the other cannot:

    - The static check runs everywhere, including the Linux and macOS CI legs
      that have no PowerShell at all.
    - The live check proves actual behavior, and runs against every installed
      edition rather than the first one found. Picking one edition is how the
      defect reached six green CI legs: this file's POWERSHELL constant prefers
      pwsh, and windows-latest ships both.

class AtomicHelperIdenticalDeploySkipTests(unittest.TestCase):
    """_atomic_deploy_helper must not rename when the target already matches.

    On Windows the rename is refused while a live session holds the helper open,
    and bootstrap exits on that failure, so a deploy that would change nothing
    fails the phase and records the whole run incomplete (anywhere-agents#44).

    The skip has to respect the executable argument as well. Returning success
    while the target is not executable would leave a helper the caller asked to
    be runnable sitting there unrunnable, which is a quieter bug than the one
    being fixed.

    These run the real function text lifted out of bootstrap.sh, with mv shadowed
    so a rename records itself and then fails the way Windows fails one onto a
    held target. A skip is therefore visible as the absence of the marker, and
    not merely as a success that might have renamed successfully.
