"""Deterministic agent-style audit over the prose a change introduces.

Findings are scoped to the lines the staged diff added or rewrote. Auditing
whole files instead reports a file's entire backlog against whatever change
happens to touch it, and a report the author cannot act on is one the author
stops reading. Pass --all-lines for the whole-file view.

In the default staged mode the bytes audited come from the index, not from
the working tree. A staged file with further unstaged edits holds different
content in each, and auditing the working tree while filtering by staged line
numbers reports on neither: a staged violation can print CLEAN, and an
unstaged one can be attributed to the commit.

Shipped as a script so every reviewer runs the same code. The hand-rolled
version this replaces was reconstructed per review out of `agent-style review
--audit-only` plus a grep for the rules that CLI reports as skipped, and an
observed run had its dash grep fail on the shell locale and match nothing.
A locale-dependent grep that matches nothing looks exactly like prose with no
violations.

ADVISORY, BY CONSTRUCTION. Every audit outcome exits 0: findings, absent
`agent_style`, an unreadable file, an unreadable index blob, nothing staged,
and any unexpected exception, which a boundary around the run converts into a
reported FAILED. That is not politeness, it is the contract: the audit runs
before Round 1, and a step that can fail is a step that can hold the review
loop open. The single exception is an argparse usage error, which exits 2,
because a malformed command line is a caller defect rather than an audit
outcome and no review-loop invocation produces one.

Style findings never enter Round history, never count toward the verdict, and
never earn another round. Three properties make that risk concrete rather
than theoretical. RULE-12 fires on any sentence over thirty words, so
splitting one long sentence can produce another, and the rule has no fixed
point. A prose fix is a diff change, and a diff change earns a round under
the normal loop rules. Handed a list of style findings, a reviewer will treat
them as findings and ask for them to be resolved.

Callers that want an exit code should read `Style status:` from stdout, or
pass --json. Nothing in the review loop should do either.
