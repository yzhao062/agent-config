"""Size gate for the shared AGENTS.md and every per-agent file generated from it.

The 2026-09 rewrite (docs/followups/2026-09-17-agents-md-diet.md) brought the
shared baseline from 74.6 KB (ac) and 66.0 KB (aa) down to one file of about
23 KB that is byte-identical in both repos. Two ceilings guard the result:

1. A rewrite gate of 24,576 bytes, the number the rewrite was sized to. It is
   what the acceptance criterion names and is kept here as the record.
2. A routine ceiling per file of the measured size plus ten percent, rounded
   up to the next 512 bytes. A change that needs more is a budget decision
   and records the new number in CEILINGS below with its reason.

Ceilings are bytes. The old version of this test in anywhere-agents used KB
constants multiplied by 1024 under a decimal name and carried 50 KB and
40 KB soft tiers that never failed; both are gone. Codex injects only the
first 32 KiB of a discovered AGENTS.md by default (project_doc_max_bytes), so
the routine ceilings also keep the baseline well inside that budget with
room for the passive packs a consumer composes in.

The file is measured through the generator on a fresh copy, so the gate
covers every agent the generator knows about, and a new generator target
without a ceiling entry fails the coverage test rather than passing unseen.
