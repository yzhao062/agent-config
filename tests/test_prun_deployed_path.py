"""Deployed-path release for prun's long-lived Bash scripts.

monitor.sh and gather.sh each run for up to an hour. Windows refuses a rename
over a file another process holds open without FILE_SHARE_DELETE, and a shell
holds a script open for as long as it is executing it, while the composer
deploys skill files by rename. Each script carries a private-copy guard so a
live run does not abort a compose transaction (anywhere-agents#43).

These two tests were the part of tests/test_dispatch_task.py that did not cover
the Codex worker scripts. Those scripts moved to legacy/prun-codex-worker/ and
their contract tests retired with them. These cover scripts that stay, so they
live here. dispatch-task.sh used to sort ahead of both and hide them, which is
why they were written in that file to begin with.
